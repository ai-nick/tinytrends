The Great Work Protocol:

In order to run a single nueroevolution algorithm across a distributed network of p2p nodes 
you must first establish a protocol (or likely a set of them) that handles the caveats that are not present
when running neuroevolution on a single machine. Here I will outline "the great work protocol" which my fellow grand architects
and I have convieved after studying many different consensus algorithms and p2p technologies. 

The Great Work Protocol at its highest level is a protocol that allows for maximum resource usage in a distributed network in which
machines may vary greatly in terms of memory size and computational power, as well as ensuring the legitimacy of the champion genomes 
(neural networks) that are found during the process of neuroevolution.
