TinyTrends:

This is a project I made at work that to help our organization gain insight into 
how correlated our sites searches are with the searches for similiar keywords in googles engine
but the library is rather generic and can be used to pull trend data for any array of keywords. 
It is called tiny trends because any search history you pull can be easily saved to a tinydb db file
as json and reloaded later so that you can keep consistent and not have to deal with repulling
and the rate limits/failures in general that are common in high frequency http requests.
